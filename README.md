### In this repository ###

In this repository you'll find a multitude of small tutorial projects on which I've focused to learn more and more about the various Python libraries that exist today. 

To do this, I decided to combine my passion for astronomy with the Python language. 

In my spare time, I'll be following little tutorials to learn more and more about this language.
