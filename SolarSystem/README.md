## Solar system simulation ##
I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim
">TechWithTim's</a> tutorial on how to create this simulation in Python. The aim for me was to understand how to create an interface and then add animation. I was also able to review the trigonometry involved in calculating the force of attraction of each planet. 

#### Added features ####
- The addition of other planets in the solar system

- The ability to zoom in and out of the solar system

- Change names to those of the planets themselves


Here is an image of the simulation that was carried out:
